* Make connections
When writing explanation you are helping to weave a web of understanding for your readers. Make connections to other things, even to things outside the immediate topic, if that helps.

* Provide context
Provide background and context in your explanation: explain why things are so - design decisions, historical reasons, technical constraints - draw implications, mention specific examples.

* Talk about the subject
Explanation guides are about a topic in the sense that they are around it. Even the names of your explanation guides should reflect this; you should be able to place an implicit (or even explicit) about in front of each title. For example: About user authentication, or About database connection policies.

* Discuss alternatives and opinions
Explanation can consider alternatives, counter-examples or multiple different approaches to the same question. You’re not giving instruction or describing facts - you’re opening up the topic for consideration. It helps to think of explanation as discussion: discussions can even consider and weigh up contrary opinions.

* Do not instruct, or provide technical reference
One risk of explanation is that other things can tend to creep in. Explanation should do things that the other parts of the documentation do not. It’s not the place of an explanation to instruct the user in how to do something. Nor should it provide technical description. These functions of documentation are already taken care of in other sections.

//Paragraphs
////
1. Write longer paragraphs if necessary.
2. Focus on the concept at hand.
3. Provide sufficient context, but avoid including unrelated or tangential information. Use links to point to related information, if it is documented somewhere else.
4. Avoid using poetic language.
